## Hello
My real name's Daniel, and I'm a 14-year-old developer wannabe from the glorious land of Moravia. I mostly use this profile for private projects and open source helper scripts, so nothing big.

### Skills
I mostly know and use Java and Groovy, but also know the basics to use C#.

### Contact
- "parkopes" (without quotes) on Discord
